# 📘 Linux System Documentation: Getting Help and Using Manual Pages

## 🔹 1. Using --help with Commands
# If you forget the options for a command, most Linux commands support the `--help` option.

ls --help

## 🔹 2. Manual Pages (man)
# To access detailed manual pages for commands, use `man` followed by the command name:

man journalctl

# ⚠️ Some commands might have multiple manual sections (e.g., functions vs commands).

## 🔹 3. apropos - Search Commands by Keyword
# If you can't remember the command name, use `apropos` to search based on keywords.

apropos director

# If it doesn't work the first time, it may be because the manual page database isn't updated:
sudo mandb

# You can limit the search to specific manual sections using the -s option:
apropos -s 1,3 director

## 🔹 4. Tab Autocompletion
# Tab helps autocomplete commands and filenames. This increases speed and reduces errors.

# Example:
# Type part of a command, like:
systemc [then press TAB]
# It will auto-complete to:
systemctl

# Pressing TAB twice will show available options or suggestions.

## 🔹 5. Using info Pages
# Some commands also have `info` pages with detailed structured documentation.

info bash

## 🔹 6. Additional Documentation
# Some software also provides extra docs in:
# /usr/share/doc

# browse this directory for package-specific documentation.
