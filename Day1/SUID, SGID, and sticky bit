# 🔐 Linux Special Permissions — SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit


---

## 🚀 What They Are

👉 **SUID (Set User ID)**  
- Only for files  
- Runs with the file **owner's power**  
- Example: `passwd` runs as root  
- Set using: `chmod u+s file`  
- Number = 4

👉 **SGID (Set Group ID)**  
- On files: runs with the file's **group**  
- On folders: new files get the **folder’s group**  
- Set using: `chmod g+s file_or_dir`  
- Number = 2

👉 **Sticky Bit**  
- Only for **folders**  
- Anyone can create files, but only the **file owner** can delete their own  
- Used in `/tmp`  
- Set using: `chmod +t folder`  
- Number = 1

## 🧠 Easy Numbers to Remember

| What You Want         | Command        |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| SUID only             | `chmod 4755 file`     |
| SGID only             | `chmod 2755 file`     |
| Sticky only           | `chmod 1755 folder`   |
| SGID + Sticky         | `chmod 3755 folder`   |
| All 3 (SUID+SGID+Sticky) | `chmod 7755 file`   |

**Tip:**  
- First number = special permissions  
- Next three = normal rwx for user/group/others

## 👀 What You’ll See in `ls -l`

| Symbol         | Means                   |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| `s`            | special bit + execute ✅ |
| `S`            | special bit only ❌ (no execute) |
| `t`            | sticky + execute ✅      |
| `T`            | sticky only ❌ (no execute) |

---

- `u+s` = SUID  
- `g+s` = SGID  
- `+t` = Sticky  
And use numbers 4 (SUID), 2 (SGID), 1 (Sticky) to combine them.
