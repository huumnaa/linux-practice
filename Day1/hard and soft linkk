##  Hard Link vs Soft Link
In Linux, we can create two types of links to a file:

### Hard Link
- Points to the **same inode** (actual file data on disk)
- Even if the original file is deleted, the hard link still works
- Cannot be created for directories
- Only works within the **same filesystem**
ln /path/to/original /path/to/hardlink

###  Soft Link (Symbolic Link)
- Points to the **file name/path**, like a shortcut
- If the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks
- Can link to both files and directories
- Works across **different filesystems**
ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/symlink

ls -li
